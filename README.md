# Data Mining
For businesses, data mining is used to discover patterns and relationships in the data in order to help make better business decisions. Data mining can help spot sales trends, develop smarter marketing campaigns, and accurately predict customer loyalty.

# Introduction to Data Mining
We can simply define data mining as a process that involves searching, collecting, filtering, and analyzing data. It is important to understand that this is not the standard or accepted definition. But the above definition caters to the whole process.

A large amount of data can be retrieved from various websites and databases. It can be retrieved in form of data relationships, correlations, and patterns. With the advent of computers, the internet, and large databases, it is possible to collect large amounts of data. The data collected can be analyzed steadily and help identify relationships and find solutions to existing problems.

Governments, private companies, large organizations, and all businesses are after a large volume of data collection for the purposes of business and research development. The data collected can be stored for future use. Storage of information is quite important whenever it is required. It is important to note that finding and searching for information from websites, databases, and other internet sources takes quite some time.

# Why do we need Data Mining?
Have a look at the below-mentioned points which explain why data mining is required.

Data mining is the procedure of capturing large sets of data in order to identify the insights and visions of that data. Nowadays, the demand of data industry is rapidly growing which has also increased the demands for data analysts and data scientists;
With this technique, we analyze the data and then convert that data into meaningful information. This helps the business to take accurate and better decisions in an organization;
Data mining helps to develop smart market decision, run accurate campaigns, make predictions, and more;
With the help of Data mining, we can analyze customer behaviors and their insights. This leads to great success and data-driven business.

# Data mining and its process
Data mining is an interactive process. Take a look at the following steps.

## 1 – Requirement gathering
Data mining projects start with requirement gathering and understanding. Data mining analysts or users define the requirement scope with the vendor business perspective. Once the scope is defined, we move to the next phase.

## 2 – Data exploration
In this step, Data mining experts gather, evaluate, and explore the requirement or project. Experts understand the problems, challenges, and convert them to metadata. In this step, data mining statistics are used to identify and convert data patterns.

## 3- Data preparations
Data mining experts convert the data into meaningful information for the modeling step. They use the ETL process – extract, transform, and load. They are also responsible for creating new data attributes. Here various tools are used to present data in a structural format without changing the meaning of data sets.

## 4- Modeling
Data experts put their best tools in place for this step as this plays a vital role in the complete processing of data. All modeling methods are applied to filter the data in an appropriate manner. Modeling and evaluation are correlated steps and are followed at the same time to check the parameters. Once the final modeling is done the final outcome is quality proven.

## 5- Evaluation
This is the filtering process after successful modeling. If the outcome is not satisfactory, then it is transferred to the model again. Upon final outcome, the requirement is checked again with the vendor so no point is missed. Data mining experts judge the complete result at the end.

## 6- Deployment
This is the final stage of the complete process. Experts present the data to vendors in the form of spreadsheets or graphs.
